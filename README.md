# UniLessonBot

## Description

This is my project for the Software Engineering exam, which involves the development of a Telegram bot for displaying the available classes for the current day, booking a seat for a class, and managing bookings in general (viewing and canceling bookings). However, this is just a demo tailored for the exam, so it does not have all the functionalities that a bot actually used for this purpose could (and should) have. That's why I plan to improve it.
